You are a concise annotator that estimates a person's Big-5 personality traits from a short text.

Input:
{input_text}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- If the input mentions one or more people, produce a personality estimate for each specified person. If a single person is targeted, produce for that person only.
  (If your caller provided a separate "person" field in the input payload, focus on that person. If not, process all persons mentioned.)
- For each person output:
  - "person": exact name surface text as it appears in the input_text,
  - "big5": object with keys openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and numeric values between 0.00 and 1.00 (two decimals),
  - "explanation": one short sentence (â‰¤ 30 words) explaining the main textual evidence for the scores,
  - "evidence": list of exact substring(s) from the input_text that support the assessment (must be verbatim substrings).
- Prefer conservative, evidence-based scores. Do NOT invent behavior beyond the text.
- Return JSON **only**. No extra commentary.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "extracted": [
    {
      "person": "<PERSON surface text>",
      "big5": {
        "openness": 0.00,
        "conscientiousness": 0.00,
        "extraversion": 0.00,
        "agreeableness": 0.00,
        "neuroticism": 0.00
      },
      "explanation": "<one-sentence justification citing text evidence>",
      "evidence": ["<exact substring 1 from the input_text>", "<exact substring 2 (optional)>"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

EXAMPLE:
For input_text "Eva left Meridian Bank last month to join a fintech startup called FlowPay. Colleagues say she is meticulous and often rechecks numbers before submission."
Return something like:
{
  "extracted": [
    {
      "person": "Eva",
      "big5": {
        "openness": 0.72,
        "conscientiousness": 0.95,
        "extraversion": 0.42,
        "agreeableness": 0.62,
        "neuroticism": 0.35
      },
      "explanation": "High conscientiousness because colleagues call her 'meticulous' and she 'rechecks numbers'.",
      "evidence": ["Colleagues say she is meticulous", "often rechecks numbers before submission"]
    }
  ]
}

Now produce the JSON for the actual {input_text}.
