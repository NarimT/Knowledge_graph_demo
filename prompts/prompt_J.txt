You are an assistant that generates a small Python module skeleton for an extraction pipeline. Produce a single Python file content for `src/pipeline.py` that orchestrates: (1) spaCy NER, (2) SVO extraction, (3) optional LLM-based relation extraction via a prompt file, (4) normalization (via canonicalize), (5) KG build via networkx and JSON-LD export, and (6) rule-based personality scoring if a `personality` module exists. The functions should be small, deterministic, and return dict artifacts. Do not assume external state. Return only the Python code.
