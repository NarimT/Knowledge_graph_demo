You are an assistant that writes pytest tests for a small pipeline. Produce a `tests/test_pipeline.py` file that:
- uses a compact sample document (Alice / Acme Corp),
- tests spaCy NER + SVO (skip if spaCy model missing),
- tests normalize.canonicalize and kg_builder.build_graph,
- tests llm_client.call_llm using a small temp prompt file (simulated),
- tests evaluation functions (if src.eval present),
and is robust to missing optional modules. Return only the Python test file content.
