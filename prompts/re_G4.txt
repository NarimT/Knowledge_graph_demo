You are an information extraction assistant. Analyze the following input and extract only relations that are explicitly stated in the text.

Input:
{input_text}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Extract relations that connect a PERSON to an ORGANIZATION or a PERSON to an OCCUPATION mentioned in the text.
- Only extract relations that are directly supported or clearly expressed in the text. Do NOT infer unstated relations.
- Use these canonical predicate labels where applicable:
  worksAt, founded, joined, leftCompany, promotedTo, contractedWith, volunteersAt,
  mentorsAt, partneredWith, organizedWith, recruitedFrom, consultedFor, hasRole, leads, role
- Use the exact surface form from the input text for "subj" and "obj".
- For each extracted triple include an "evidence" list containing one or more exact substrings taken verbatim from the input text that support the extraction.
- Return JSON **only**. No commentary, no extra text.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "extracted": [
    {
      "subj": "<PERSON surface text>",
      "pred": "<canonical predicate>",
      "obj": "<ORGANIZATION or OCCUPATION surface text>",
      "evidence": ["<exact substring 1 from the input_text>", "<exact substring 2 (optional)>"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

EXAMPLE:
If the input_text is "Alice joined Acme Corp as a project manager last month."
Return:
{
  "extracted": [
    {
      "subj": "Alice",
      "pred": "worksAt",
      "obj": "Acme Corp",
      "evidence": ["Alice joined Acme Corp as a project manager last month"]
    },
    {
      "subj": "Alice",
      "pred": "hasRole",
      "obj": "project manager",
      "evidence": ["as a project manager"]
    }
  ]
}

Now produce the JSON for the actual {input_text}.
