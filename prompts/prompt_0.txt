You are a technical writer. Produce a concise markdown document (max 600 words) titled "Design choices for KG + Personality Pipeline" that explains the main design choices: spaCy for core NLP, hybrid RE (OpenIE + rules), local canonicalization, reified TraitAssertion with provenance, rule-based + LLM personality ensemble, evaluation metrics used (P/R/F1, MAE, Pearson), and reproducibility measures (docker/requirements, logging prompts/responses). Focus on rationale and one risk per choice. Return markdown only.
