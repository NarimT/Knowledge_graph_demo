Short intro: label only what is explicitly present or clearly implied in the sentence set. Use the dataset ID and entity ID format DOCID_E# for all annotations. For personality use numeric scores in [0.00,1.00] (two decimals) and add a one-sentence justification citing evidence (span or phrase).

1) Entities (≤10 checklist items)

Select spans that name real-world referents (people, organizations, occupations). Use the shortest meaningful span (e.g., Alice, Acme Corp, Head of Design).

Allowed types: Person, Organization, Occupation (or Other if none fit). Tag exactly one type per entity.

Assign an ID: DOCID_E# (increment within document in left-to-right order).

Do not create separate entity records for pronouns — instead link pronouns to the referenced Person via coreference (see relations step).

If a name + title appears (e.g., “Dr. Ben Rivera”), span the full name but normalize text to the common name (Ben Rivera) in metadata if needed.

Treat institutions and collective nouns as Organization (e.g., community, local shelter, Nimbus Telecom).

Merge aliases within the same document (e.g., Acme and Acme Corp) — record one entity and list aliases in comments.

If ambiguous (is it a shop name vs. a person?), mark entity as Ambiguous with a short note rather than guessing.

Don’t invent entities not supported by text (no inference across documents).

For each entity include id, text, and type; optional span_offsets are encouraged.

2) Relations (≤10 checklist items)

Only annotate relations that connect two annotated entities within the same document. Use subj_id, pred, obj_id.

Use the provided predicate set when applicable (worksAt, founded, joined, left, volunteersAt, mentorsAt, partneredWith, promotedTo, contractedWith, organizedWith, consultedFor, recruitedFrom, etc.). If none fit, add a concise verb phrase (snake_case).

Relation direction matters: subj -> pred -> obj must reflect the text (e.g., Alice worksAt Acme).

Only assert relations that are explicitly stated or very directly implied in the text (e.g., “Alice joined Acme” → joined). Avoid speculative relations (e.g., “Alice met Bob once” does not imply worksWith).

Multiple relations between same entities are allowed if the text supports them (e.g., founded and affiliatedWith).

When a relation is supported by a specific clause, include a short evidence note or span (recommended).

For coreference, resolve relations to the canonical entity (e.g., “She organized…” → use the Person entity id).

If tense/time matters (past vs present) preserve it in an optional tense field; otherwise omit.

If relation is ambiguous, add confidence: low and a short justification.

Validate that both subj_id and obj_id reference existing gold_entities.

3) Personality scores (Big-5) (≤10 checklist items)

For each Person entity in the doc, provide big5 scores openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism as floats in [0.00,1.00] with two decimals. If evidence is absent, use null (do not guess).

Provide a one-sentence justification per person linking score assignments to explicit text (cite span or phrase) — e.g., “High conscientiousness (0.95) — ‘meticulous’ and ‘rechecks numbers’.”

Use these conservative mapping heuristics (guidance, not strict rules):

Conscientiousness: organizing, meeting deadlines, meticulous/rechecks numbers → ↑ score.

Extraversion: speaks at conferences, recruits volunteers, greets warmly, leads sessions → ↑ score.

Agreeableness: volunteers, resolves conflicts empathetically, patient/resolves complaints → ↑ score.

Openness: takes creative risks, encourages creative projects, founder of new lab → ↑ score.

Neuroticism: expresses worry, frequent cautioning about pitfalls, emotional instability → ↑ score (higher = more prone).

Prefer coarse but justified differences: round to .05–.10 steps (e.g., 0.60, 0.70, 0.95) rather than tiny granular values.

When text contains direct psychometric language (e.g., “highly anxious”), reflect it in neuroticism accordingly.

If multiple contradictory cues exist, annotate both with notes and set confidence (0.0–1.0). Example field: "confidence": 0.7.

If a trait is only weakly implied, assign a mid value (e.g., 0.50) or null and note low confidence.

Keep explanations factual and cite exact phrases; avoid bringing external stereotypes (“engineers are X”) into the justification.

Store personality labels under the person’s entity id: personality_labels: { PERSON_ID: { big5: {...}, explanation: "..." } }.

For QA, every annotated person must have a short justification; missing justifications make the label invalid.
