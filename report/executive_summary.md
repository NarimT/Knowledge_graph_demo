# Executive Summary

This project delivers a reproducible pipeline that extracts structured knowledge (entities and relations) and personality trait estimates from short text documents. The pipeline is designed to run locally and ship as a GitHub repository with clear instructions, example data, and artifact logging.

Key outcomes:
- **Structured output (KG):** People, organizations, occupations and their relations are extracted into a machine-readable graph for search, analytics, and downstream reasoning.
- **Personality estimates:** For each person mentioned, the system produces five trait scores (Big-5) together with provenance and a short explanation. Scores are reported on a 0–1 scale and are interpretable (MAE units).
- **Evaluation:** Relation extraction is measured with Precision / Recall / F1 to balance correctness and coverage. Personality is evaluated using MAE (how far off scores are on average) and Pearson correlation (whether the system preserves relative rankings). These metrics allow quantitative tracking of improvements.

Recommended next steps:
1. **Targeted annotation:** Create a small, prioritized gold dataset for the most important relation types and personality examples — this will enable supervised model fine-tuning and more reliable evaluation.  
2. **Iterate on rules & lexicons:** Use the error analysis (top false positives/negatives and worst MAE cases) to improve high-impact rules and expand lexicons.  
3. **Production considerations:** If moving to production, add privacy-safe storage, stricter auditing of LLM outputs, and CI tests that run the demo on a small sample.

This lightweight, auditable pipeline enables immediate experimentation and provides a clear roadmap for improving coverage and accuracy.
